## Concept

We have gone for an idea which is inspired by the TV show love island, and Are You The One? We originally had a story which was agood ground however it didnt have enough detail to it. We had decided to involve a drug testing element in the story where the participants do not know what they are actually signed up for. The Villa is a fake company which provides food and accomodation to the participants and use them in drug tests while they sleep.
